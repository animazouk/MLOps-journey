# Day 3: 2D Lists, Exceptions, File I/O, Modules

**Date:** November 16, 2025  
**Handle:** [@adarsh4553](https://x.com/adarsh4553)  
**Status:** **COMPLETED (Only my code)**

---

### Files (Made by ME):
- `day3_master_script.py` → My full learning from video
- `employees.txt` → Created and modified by my script
- `grid_analyzer.py` → Practice (2D lists + nested loops)
- `safe_input.py` → Practice (exception handling)
- `file_logger.py` → Practice (file I/O)
- `password_gen.py` → **MINI PROJECT** (secure password CLI)

---

### Learned:
- 2D lists: `grid[row][col]`
- Nested `for` loops
- `try/except` for `ZeroDivisionError`, `ValueError`
- File modes: `"a+"` → read + append
- `seek(0)` to read after opening in append
- `import translator` (external module)

---

### Challenges:
- File pointer confusion → fixed with `seek(0)`
- `translator` module not installed → learned `pip`

---


### Mini Project:
> `password_gen.py` — Secure password generator CLI with strength meter, categories, and secure randomness using `secrets` module.
