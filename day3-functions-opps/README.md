# Day 3: 2D Lists, Exceptions, File I/O, Modules

**Date:** November 14, 2025  
**Handle:** [@adarsh4553](https://x.com/adarsh4553)  
**Status:** **COMPLETED (Only my code)**

---

### Files (Made by ME):
- `day3_master_script.py` → My full learning from video
- `employees.txt` → Created and modified by my script

---

### Learned:
- 2D lists: `grid[row][col]`
- Nested `for` loops
- `try/except` for `ZeroDivisionError`, `ValueError`
- File modes: `"a+"` → read + append
- `seek(0)` to read after opening in append
- `import translator` (external module)

---

### Challenges:
- File pointer confusion → fixed with `seek(0)`
- `translator` module not installed → learned `pip`
